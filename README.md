# PyTorch Basics and Image Classification Project

Welcome to the PyTorch Basics and Image Classification Project repository! This repository contains two main files that cover different aspects of deep learning using PyTorch.

## Files

1. **`Tensor_PyTorch.ipynb`**: This Jupyter Notebook provides an introduction to the basics of PyTorch and tensors. It covers fundamental concepts such as creating tensors, performing operations, and understanding the basics of PyTorch's computational graph.

2. **`DeepLearning_with_PyTorch.ipynb`**: In this Jupyter Notebook, you'll find a complete project on image classification using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) implemented with PyTorch. The project demonstrates how to preprocess image data, design a simple ANN architecture, train the model, and evaluate its performance on a given dataset.

## Getting Started

To make the most of this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

2. Open the `Tensor_PyTorch.ipynb` notebook to explore PyTorch basics and learn about tensors.

3. Move on to the `DeepLearning_with_PyTorch.ipynb` notebook to delve into the image classification project.

## Dependencies

Both notebooks assume that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- PyTorch (>=1.0)
- Jupyter Notebook


## Contributing
